This project demonstrates the end-to-end data analytics pipeline using Python and Tableau.

Sales Data and Employee Data were taken from different sources.

Cleaned both datasets individually (handled outliers, missing values, formatting issues, and special characters).

Merged the datasets to create a unified dataset for deeper analysis.

Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

Built an interactive Tableau dashboard for Sales & Employee Performance Analysis.
